# Random-Quote-Generator
An app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. Vanilla JS and CSS. 

## Project Instructions

Create an array of JavaScript objects to hold the data for your quotes. Name the array *quotes*. 
The *quotes* array should be accessible in the global scope.  

Each quote object in the *quotes* array should have the following properties:
* A *quote* property which contains a string: the text of the quote that will be displayed on the page.

* A *source* property which contains a string identifying the creator of the quote. For example: "Mark Twain" or "Traditional Irish proverb.”

* An optional *citation* property which contains a string identifying where the quote comes from, like a speech or publication. For example, "Famous Anonymous Jokes." If there is no known publication, do not include this property on the object.

* An optional *year* property which contains a number identifying the date of the quote. For example, 1997. If there is no known date, then do not include this property on the object.


Create a function named *getRandomQuote* which:
* selects a random quote object from the quotes array
* returns the randomly selected quote object


Create a function named *printQuote* which follows these rules:
* *printQuote* calls the *getRandomQuote* function and stores the returned quote object in a variable
* *printQuote* constructs a string containing the different properties of the quote object using the following HTML template:

```
<p class="quote"> [quote here] </p>
<p class="source"> [source here]
  <span class="citation"> [citation here] </span>
  <span class="year"> [year here] </span>
</p>
```

* *printQuote* doesn't add a `<span class="citation">` for a missing citation or a `<span class="year">` if the year property is missing
* *printQuote* displays the final HTML string to the page. You can use this JS snippet to accomplish that:  document.getElementById('quote-box').innerHTML`


## Extra Credit

Add more properties to the quote object. For example, a *tags* property could include a list of "tags" like "humor", "business", or "politics" to categorize each quote.

When the quote changes, randomly change the background color of the page.

Refresh the quote after a set amount of time. For example, every 30 seconds, make a new quote appear. (You can use the setInterval() or setTimeout() method to do this -- see the links in the “Additional Resources” section).
